# 🔍 Overview
As a data analyst, I worked on a comprehensive sales analysis project for a chain of coffee shop. The goal was to deliver actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends using SQL and Power BI. This case study demonstrates my ability to clean raw transactional data using SQL, build data models with Power Query and DAX, and design a clear, business-friendly interactive dashboard.

# 🎯 Objectives
1. Clean and structure sales data using SQL
2. Analyze trends in sales, orders, and quantity over time
3. Identify best-performing products and store locations
4. Compare weekday vs. weekend performance
5. Visualize findings using Power BI for stakeholders

# 🛠️ Tools Used
**SQL (MySQL)** | **Power BI** | **Power Query Editor** | **DAX**

# 🧹 SQL Work (with CTE)
I used Structured Query Language (SQL) extensively to:
Convert text dates and times to appropriate formats
Calculate monthly totals and perform comparisons
Create reusable logic with CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for:
- Month-on-month change in sales
- Month-on-month change in orders
- Monthly comparison of quantity sold

# 💡 Skills Demonstrated
SQL cleaning, transformation, and CTE-based analytics
Building calculated KPIs using DAX
Data shaping with Power Query
Visualization and storytelling with Power BI
Business-oriented thinking and insight derivation
