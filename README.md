# 🔍 Overview
As a data analyst, I worked on a comprehensive sales analysis project for a chain of coffee shop. The goal was to deliver actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends using SQL and Power BI. This case study demonstrates my ability to clean raw transactional data using SQL, build data models with Power Query and DAX, and design a clear, business-friendly interactive dashboard.

# 🎯 Objectives
1. Clean and structure sales data using SQL
2. Analyze trends in sales, orders, and quantity over time
3. Identify best-performing products and store locations
4. Compare weekday vs. weekend performance
5. Visualize findings using Power BI for stakeholders

# 🛠️ Tools Used
**SQL (MySQL)** | **Power BI** | **Power Query Editor** | **DAX**

# 🧹 SQL Work (with CTE)
I used Structured Query Language (SQL) extensively to:\
Convert text dates and times to appropriate formats\
Calculate monthly totals and perform comparisons\
Create reusable logic with CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for:
- Month-on-month change in sales
- Month-on-month change in orders
- Monthly comparison of quantity sold

# 💡 Skills Demonstrated
SQL cleaning, transformation, and CTE-based analytics\
Building calculated KPIs using DAX\
Data shaping with Power Query\
Visualization and storytelling with Power BI\

# 📈 Dashboard Visualization
In the Power BI dashboard, I created key measures using DAX such as Total Sales, Orders, and Quantity Sold to dynamically calculate performance metrics. I added a month slicer that allows users to filter visuals by specific months, making trend analysis more interactive and focused. Charts like sales by store, product categories, and top products help identify high-performing areas and customer preferences. A pie chart showing weekday vs weekend sales reveals behavioral patterns. These visual elements combined offer actionable insights for inventory planning, marketing, and store-level decisions.\
